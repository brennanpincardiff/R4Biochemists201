These pages have been created to help learners for R for Biochemists 201 
and to help the author (me) with version control. 

Within the R folder is the code used in each module. There are answers to the
Exercises too. 

Within the RMarkdown_files folder is the RMarkdown files used to compile
teaching materials. 

Some data is present in the data folder. 

Questions about these materials should be addressed to Dr Paul Brennan. 
Contact can be made by email (brennanpincardiff@gmail.com), 
[twitter](https://twitter.com/brennanpcardiff) (@brennanpcardiff) 
or here on Github. Issues and pull requests are welcome.
