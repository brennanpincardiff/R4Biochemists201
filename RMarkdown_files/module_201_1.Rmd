### Welcome to the first R for Biochemists 201 Training module.

Each module is designed to take approximately 60 minutes to complete. 

The material provided includes text to read, video demonstrations, an example R script with exercise. We hope you enjoy the modules. We welcome feedback and comments. 

### How to use this module 
1. To learn from this module, cut and paste the R code into R-Studio and then run the code line by line. 
2. See if you can make the script work
3. Watch the demonstration videos to see how the code works
4. Look at how the 'Global Environment' changes.
5. Change the code and test it
6. Try the exercises at the end
7. Extend your learning using the resources at the end

### Learning Objectives for Module 1
* Understand tidy data 
* Understand data analysis workflows 
* Use the dplyr package to reformat and summarize data

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```


### Introducing tidy data
##### First video - Tidy data 

```{r data_for_tidying}
# first example - relatively simple
link <- "https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/RforBiochemists/raw/master/data/Viability_data_example_R201_20200722_for_tidying.xls"

download.file(url=link, destfile="Viability_data_example.xls", mode="wb")

ex_1 <- read_xls("Viability_data_example.xls")

# Look at the file
ex_1
# View(ex_1)

# we can use the gather() function to focus on our two columns
tidy_ex1 <- gather(ex_1[,2:3])

# rename with useful names
colnames(tidy_ex1) <- c("Treatment", "Viability")
tidy_ex1

# make a plot...
ggplot(tidy_ex1, aes(Treatment, Viability)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean")

# second example - a more obvious change from wide into long format
link <- "https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/RforBiochemists/raw/master/data/untidy_drug_data_ex_1.csv"

download.file(url=link, destfile="untidy_data_ex_2.csv", mode="wb")

ex_2 <- read.csv("untidy_data_ex_2.csv")
ex_2 
# so even the column names are a bit of a challenge...
colnames(ex_2)

# column names with numbers cause a problem for R. 

# we will use the pivot_longer() function 
# we exclude the drug concentration colum 
# and we exclude the NA cells...
data2 <- pivot_longer(ex_2, -"X.SU_drug_1..M", values_to = "apoptosis",
                      values_drop_na = TRUE)

# rename 
colnames(data2) <- c("Conc", "name", "apop")

# Look at the file
# View(data2)
data2
# make a plot...
ggplot(data2, aes(x = Conc, y = apop)) + geom_point() +
    scale_x_log10() 
```

### The Experiment
I have chosen a recent Nature publication by Croft et al. Nature now require
authors to share their data and these authors have supplied their data as an 
Excel file. The authors have analysed fibroblast subsets and how they contribute
to arthritis in a mouse model. 

The title of the paper is:
"Distinct fibroblast subsets drive inflammation and damage in arthritis""
Copies are available here:
[Online](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1263-7)
[PDF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1263-7.pdf)
Also in [Biorxiv as preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/374330v1)

We are going to explore the data in
[Figure 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1263-7/figures/1).

The [data is available](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-019-1263-7/MediaObjects/41586_2019_1263_MOESM8_ESM.xlsx).

The Excel file has 9 worksheets - each sheet corresponding to a part of the 
figure. 

Our workflow is 
1. Import the data
2. Tidy our data (also known as wrangling or munging)
3. Transform or summarise
4. Visualize

![Data Analysis Workflow](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/blob/master/diagrams/data-science-communicate.png)


### Importing our data in R
##### Second video - importing and tidying our data 
```{r get_data_for_Fig_1b}
link <- "https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-019-1263-7/MediaObjects/41586_2019_1263_MOESM8_ESM.xlsx"

# the download.file() function downloads and saves the file with the name given
download.file(url=link, destfile="file.xlsx", mode="wb")

# check worksheet names 
sheet_names <- excel_sheets("file.xlsx")
data <- read_excel("file.xlsx", sheet_names[1])
```

If you look at the R-Studio environment window, you will see that the object
data has appeared there.

### Tidy our data
The data is in a wide format. Each treatment is in a column. 
Biochemical data is often presented in this way and we could graph it like this. 
However, things will work better if we turn the data into long format that is
more of the structure we like for Tidy Data. 
We can use the gather() function which does this very simply. There are other
ways to do this too but this works well. 
Then we want to turn our keys into factors using the mutate function. 

```{r tidy_data_for_Fig_1b}
# data in wide format...
# put into long tidy format... using gather()...

data_2 <- gather(data, na.rm = TRUE)
# make the key a factor - important for graphing and stats
data_2 %>% mutate(key = factor(key, c("Control", "Resolving", "RA"))) -> data_3
```

### Exercise 1
You can test your knowledge with the data for Figure 1j from the same 
publication.
```{r figure_1j}
data_1j <- read_excel("file.xlsx", sheet_names[5])
```
Remember the next step is tidying...

### Answers for Exercise 1
Here is the code 
```{r exercise_1_answer} 
data_1j <- read_excel("file.xlsx", sheet_names[5])

# data in wide format...
# put into long tidy format... with gather and spread...
data_1j_l <- gather(data_1j, na.rm = TRUE)
# make the key a factor - important for graphing and stats
data_1j_l %>% mutate(key = factor(key, c("Control", "STIA"))) -> data_1j_lf
```
Does the data look correct to you?



### Make a bar plot
##### Second video - bar plots 
In Biology and Biochemistry, we like bar charts and making one with this data
is easy. By combining our plotting function, ggplot() and geom_bar() we can 
ask it to  summarise our data and plot the mean of our data. 
Here is the code to do this

```{r barchart}
# bar chart plot with the mean of each column...
ggplot(data_3, aes(key, value)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean")  
```

Why do we like barplots? Well, our eyes interpret the y axis quite easily. 
We can differentiate the sizes of the numbers. We like bar charts in 
biochemistry. However, is it much better than just the numbers?


### Summarize as lines or show the individual data points
Bar charts have limits and there is a proposition they hide more than they 
reveal. Bar charts use a lot of ink for showing the numbers. For example, 
it is not really better than just generating lines without the bars...
We can use the group_by() and summarise() functions in our first piped workflow.
Then we can plot the calculated means as lines. 


```{r plot_means_as_lines}
# bar chart plot
data_3 %>%
    group_by(key) %>%
    summarise(mean(value), sd(value)) -> data_3_stats
colnames(data_3_stats) <- c("key", "value", "sd")

# create plot with summary data...
# add the mean value as a line
ggplot(data_3_stats, aes(key, value)) + 
    geom_point(shape = 95, size = 8)

# we can also use the mean and standard deviation to add a error bar
# to this or to our bar chart...

# bar chart plot
ggplot(data_3, aes(key, value)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean") +
    geom_errorbar(data = data_3_stats, aes(ymin=value-sd, ymax=value+sd), 
                  width=.2,
                  position=position_dodge(.9)) 
```

I have to confess that I don't really like either of these plots. 
What can we do better? Well we can show the points to show the variation 
using geom_jitter().

```{r geom_jitter}
# then add points with geom_jitter()
# but control shapes/colours 
# solid black circles, hollow black circles, solid grey circles
ggplot(data_3, aes(key, value, shape = key, colour=key)) +
     geom_jitter(width = 0.1)

```


We can plot these both together.

```{r mean_and_geom_jitter}
# plot the mean first...
plot <- ggplot(data_3_stats, aes(key, value))
# add the mean value as a line
plot <- plot + geom_point(shape = 95, size = 8)


plot <- plot + geom_jitter(data=data_3, 
    aes(key, value, colour=key), width = 0.1) 
plot

```

### Exercise 2
Using the data from Figure 1j, play with the data to plot 
* A bar chart
* The points with geom_jitter

### Answers for Exercise 2
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# bar plot
ggplot(data_1j_lf, aes(key, value)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean")

# calculating
data_1j_lf %>%
    group_by(key) %>%
    summarise(mean(value)) -> data_1j_stats
colnames(data_1j_stats) <- c("key", "mean")

# mean as a line and geom_jitter
ggplot(data_1j_stats, aes(key, mean)) + 
    geom_point(shape = 95, size = 8) +
    geom_jitter(data=data_1j_lf, 
    aes(key, value, colour=key), width = 0.1)



```

However, there is easier way, I think. 
Box and whisker plots offer a nice option.

### Try box and whisker plots
##### Third video - box and whisker and violin plots 
Another option, better than a bar plot is to try a box and whisker plot.
This summarises the data automatically. 
```{r box_whisker}
ggplot(data_3, aes(key, value, shape = key, colour=key)) +
     geom_boxplot() 

```

The default values for the geom_boxplot() function are to show the mean,
quartiles and outliers. You can combine these two plots to show the summary 
data and the individual plots. If we do that we need to remove the outliers
from geom_boxplot() or we will plot those twice. 

```{r box_whisker_with_points}
ggplot(data_3, aes(key, value, shape = key, colour=key)) +
     geom_boxplot(outlier.size=0) +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.1)

```


A colleague with lots more statistical experience taught me about violin
plots. Remember, I'm a biochemists not a statistician. These show more of the 
data variation across the plot. Just change your geom and change your plot.  

```{r violin_plot}
ggplot(data_3, aes(key, value, shape = key, colour=key)) +
     geom_violin() +
     geom_jitter(width = 0.1)

```

### Exercise 3
With the data from Figure 1j, try making a box and whisker plot and a
violin plot.

### Answers for Exercise 3
Here is the code 
```{r} 
ggplot(data_1j_lf, aes(key, value, colour=key)) +
     geom_boxplot() +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.1)

ggplot(data_1j_lf, aes(key, value, colour=key)) +
     geom_violin() +
    geom_jitter(width = 0.1)


```

### Bring workflow together with pipes
With the option of pipes we can put all of this together in a 
workflow and add labels and a source. 
```{r} 
data %>%
    gather(na.rm = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(key = factor(key, c("Control", "Resolving", "RA"))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(key, value, shape = key, colour=key)) +
     geom_boxplot(outlier.size=0) +
     geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
     ylim(0,0.2) + 
     labs(x = "",
     y = "FAPalpha expression (pixels per unit area)", 
     title = "Figure 1b",
     subtitle = "Croft et al, Nature, 2019") +
     theme_classic() + theme(legend.position="none")

```

Do you think you could do this with the data for Figure 1c?

```{r} 
data_1j %>%
    gather(na.rm = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(key = factor(key, c("Control", "STIA"))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(key, value, shape = key, colour=key)) +
     geom_boxplot(outlier.size=0) +
     geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
     ylim(0,0.2) + 
     labs(x = "",
     y = "Bioluminescence", 
     title = "Figure 1j",
     subtitle = "Croft et al, Nature, 2019") +
     theme_classic() + theme(legend.position="none")

```
