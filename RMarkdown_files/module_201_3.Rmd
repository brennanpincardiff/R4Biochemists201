### Welcome to the third R for Biochemists 201 Training module.

This module goes in a slightly different direction. We are going to talk about
a way to integrate text and code to try to make your analysis more reproducible.
In our pilot, learners took about 2 hours to complete this module. Please don't
worry if it takes you longer. Rather be patient with yourself and try to keep
learning. Take a break as you need and ask questions if you need help. 

### How to use this module 
1. To learn from this module, watch the video and open a new R Markdown file. 
2. Look at the file and see if you can understand the different parts of the file
3. Write some text and Knit your file to HTML
4. Watch the demonstration videos to see how you can change the file
5. Change the file, Knit to see the changes in the output
6. Play and repeat
7. Try the exercises
8. Extend your learning using the resources at the end

### Learning Objectives for Module 3
* Open an R Markdown file, edit it and create output 
* Add text and formatting to an R Markdown file
* Add new R code to an R Markdown file
* Create output of different types from your R Markdown files

The aim of this module is to introduce R Markdown. A workflow that allows
us to mix text, data analysis and visualisations in a way that allows us to 
output and share what we make. 
As part of this workflow, the tidyverse steps of importing, tidying, 
transforming, visualising, modelling and communicating will be followed. This
module builds on the previous modules with a focus on communicating your data 
in a reproducible way. 

### First step - open your first R Markdown file
##### First video - opening, editing and outputting an R Markdown file 

* Go to the _File_ menu
* Select _New File_
* Go to _R Markdown..._

A dialog box will ask you to complete title, author and to select the 
default output options. 
I recommend that you add a meaningful title. For example, you could add a title
"module_3".
I recommend that you select HTML in the first instance.
Output format can be changed at a later date. 

#### The R Markdown file has three parts:
1. A Header surrounded by three dashes "---"
2. Text 
3. R code blocks or chunks surrounded by special quote marks

#### Knit your first R Markdown file
At the top of the R-Studio window you will see a _Knit_ button. Press this and
you will be invited to _Save_ your R Markdown file and output will be produced. 
If you go to your file system, you will notice that a .html file has been
created. This has the same name as your R Markdown file which ends with .Rmd. 
This html file can be opened by a browser like Google Chrome if you double
click the file. Thus you can now share your analysis with a collegue even if
they don't have R or any knowledge of R. All they need is a browser. 

### Second step - some text options 
The advanage of R Markdown is that we can mix text that gives 
context to our analysis as well as code that will perform the analysis. 

The text options are quite simple. 

#### Headers
You can add headers of different levels
one # is the top level header all the way down to six levels of header. 

#### Bold and italic
Using two asterix gives **text in bold** using underscore _gives text in italics_

#### Lists with numbers or bullets
We can add unordered lists with asterix _*_ and ordered list with numbers. 

##### R for Data Science workflow
* Import data
* Tidy data
* Visualise data

#### Weblinks and images
Using greater than and less than allows the inclusion of web links.
For example:
Check out the R Markdown cheatsheet for more information 
<https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf>

We can add a linked phrase to my [R for Biochemists website](http://rforbiochemists.blogspot.com/)

We can add images from the web or locally with a path

### Exercise 1
Please test your knowledge by creating a new R Markdown file.

- Select your favourite protein...
- Add some information about it...
- Add some links about it...
- Add a picture of it from somewhere


### Answers for Exercise 1
A video showing you how I did this is available online. 

### Let's analyse some data in your R Markdown file
We are going to continue with data from the 2019 Nature publication by Croft 
et al. The data is available online and can be imported directly into R for 
analysis. The authors have analysed fibroblast subsets and how they contribute
to arthritis in a mouse model. 
I will put in a workflow for Figure 1h which is a linear fitting of data...

Note that we add text and then put the R code surrounded by these three ticks...
We can add titles to the R code to tell us what it does. These titles need to 
be unique to that R code. They can help identifying problems with our code. 

##### Another video - data analysis in R Markdown file
First, activate the packages we need. Note that we are adding message = FALSE
for the R code. This will make the document easier to read. 
```{r packages_we_need, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(ggpubr)
```

As before, the title of the paper is:
"Distinct fibroblast subsets drive inflammation and damage in arthritis""
Copies are available here:
[Online](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1263-7)
[PDF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1263-7.pdf)
Also in [Biorxiv as preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/374330v1)

Continuing our exploration of the data in
[Figure 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1263-7/figures/1).

The workflow: 

1. Import the data
2. Tidy our data (also known as wrangling or munging)
3. Transform or summarise
4. Visualize


### Importing the data in R

```{r download_data_for_Fig_1h}
link <- "https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-019-1263-7/MediaObjects/41586_2019_1263_MOESM8_ESM.xlsx"

# the download.file() function downloads and saves the file with the name given
download.file(url=link, destfile="file.xlsx", mode="wb")

# get worksheet names 
sheet_names <- excel_sheets("file.xlsx")
```

The name of the sheet we're going to download is **`r sheet_names[4]`**. This
also shows how we can add some in-line R code. 

We can create a little test using an if() statement but we don't need to show
the code in our document so we can use the echo=FALSE argument to prevent this. 
```{r test_file_name, echo=FALSE}
# we can add a little test into our data to ensure we have the correct data.
if (sheet_names[4] == "Figure 1h") {
print("We wanted Figure 1h so we have the correct file")
}else {
print("I don't think we have the correct file, please check your code...")
}
```

Since we are happy with the file, import it...
I looked at the file in Excel and there is no data on the first line. It is
best if we skip that line. 

```{r import_data_for_Fig_1h}
data <- read_excel("file.xlsx", sheet_names[4], skip = 1)

```
The read_excel function also ignore the blank column. Generally the data looks
OK. The name of the first column is a bit difficult. Just a little tidying is required. Then, visualise and analyse. 

```{r basic_line_graph}
# simplify column names for ease...
colnames(data) <- c("thick", "biolum")

# basic dot plot with a fitted line
ggplot(data, aes(thick, biolum)) +
    geom_point() +
    stat_smooth(method = "lm") 
```


We can customise this graph in a variety of ways. Add titles, limits for 
the axis and a theme that is similar to the paper. 
```{r more_customised_line_graph}
# more detailed dot plot with a fitted line
ggplot(data, aes(thick, biolum)) +
    geom_point() +
    stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color="black") +   
  xlab("Thickness (mm)") +   # label x-axis
  ylab("Bioluminescence") +    # label y-axis
  ggtitle("Croft et al, 2019, Figure 1h") +  # add a title
  expand_limits(y=c(0,10), x = c(0,2)) +
  theme_classic()
```

We have used the 
[ggpubr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpubr/)
to add statistics so we can do the same here. 
Using the ggscatter() function will draw the plot and add the statistics to the plot.

```{r line_graph_with_stats}
# stats with ggscatter
ggscatter(data, x = "thick", y = "biolum",
    add = "reg.line",  # Add regression line
    cor.coef = TRUE, # Add correlation coefficient. see ?stat_cor
    cor.coeff.args = list(method = "spearman"),
    xlab = "Thickness (mm)",
    ylab = "Bioluminesence",
    ylim = c(0, 10),
    xlim = c(0,2),
    title = "Croft et al, 2019, Figure 1h"
)

```



### Exercise 2
Please try this for Figure 1m which is another linear plot. 
It is the 8th sheet in the downloaded file. 

### Answers for Exercise 2
```{r, exercise_2}
data_2 <- read_excel("file.xlsx", sheet_names[8], skip = 1)
colnames(data_2) <- c("thick", "express")

# you can plot it in ggplot but you will need to calculate the stats 
# and add them manually
ggplot(data_2, aes(thick, express)) +
    geom_point() +
    stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color="black") +   
  xlab("Thickness (mm)") +   # label x-axis
  ylab("mRNA expression") +    # label y-axis
  ggtitle("Croft et al, 2019, Figure 1m") +  # add a title
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-4,12), breaks=c(-4,-2,0,2,4,6,8,10,12)) +
  theme_classic()
```   

Or you can make a graph with ggscatter() but you will need to modify the y-axis
using scale_y_continuous() afterwards with limits and breads to give the 
numbers on the axis. 

```{r, more_for_exercise_2}
# make the plot with ggscatter()
plot <- ggscatter(data_2, x = "thick", y = "express",
    add = "reg.line",  # Add regression line
    cor.coef = TRUE, # Add correlation coefficient. see ?stat_cor
    cor.coeff.args = list(method = "spearman"),
    xlab = "Thickness (mm)",
    ylab = "mRNA expression",
    xlim = c(0,1.5),
    title = "Croft et al, 2019, Figure 1m"  # add a title
)
# use scale_y_continuous() to alter the y axis 
plot + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-4,12), breaks=c(-4,-2,0,2,4,6,8,10,12))



```

### Outputs Rmd in various formats....
##### Third video - Making a Word document and a presentation
###### A Word Document 
As an example for this video, I am going to use the R Markdown file for this
module. It is available on [Github](https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/R4Biochemists201/blob/master/RMarkdown_files/module_201_3.Rmd). 

You can download it with this code:
```{r, download_Rmd_mod_3, eval= FALSE}
# download Rmd file for module 3 from the internet and open in R-Studio
link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennanpincardiff/R4Biochemists201/master/RMarkdown_files/module_201_3.Rmd"
download.file(url=link, destfile="module_201_3.Rmd", mode="wb")
file.edit("module_201_3.Rmd")
```

First Knit to HTML...
Then Knit to Word...


###### A Presentation
A useful output method is Presentations. Using isoslides is a good start. 
As before:

* Go to the _File_ menu
* Select _New File_
* Go to _R Markdown..._

Now select Presentation and give the file a name. Trying knitting the sample 
code and see if you can get it to work. 

Check out my R journey

You can download it with this code:
```{r, download_Rmd_paul_story, eval= FALSE}
link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennanpincardiff/R4Biochemists201/master/RMarkdown_files/data_for_good_Cardiff.Rmd"
download.file(url=link, destfile="paul_R_story.Rmd", mode="wb")
file.edit("paul_R_story.Rmd")
```


### Exercise 3
Try to create and share your R journey. 
Insert some of the code you have written. 
I have published my story here.

### Answers for Exercise 3
The Rmd source file for my R journey is [here](https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/R4Biochemists201/blob/master/RMarkdown_files/data_for_good_Cardiff.Rmd). 
You can download it, open it in R-Studio.
Edit it, make it yours and Knit it

### Code chunk options
##### Fourth video - options for code chunks... 
There are options for customising how RMarkdown will use the code in a code block or chunk. This is illustrated in the video. 

* We can avoid the messages by writing message=FALSE
* We can NOT show the code by using echo = FALSE.
* With eval = TRUE, the code is run. 
* If we change eval=FALSE, the code is not run.

### Review what we have learned
* We have created R Markdown files.
* Within our R Mardown file we have: 
    + imported data
    + tidied data
    + visualised data
    
* We have generated output:
    + in html format that can be opened in a browser
    + Word format that can be printed and shared
    + with different data in a similar format
    
* We have explored the options for code chunks:
    + showing and running the code
    + hiding and running the code to generate output
    + showing code but not running (evaluating) 

### Resources
* You could move onto Module 4
* Check out Communicate Data chapters of R for Data Science)<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/communicate-intro.html>
* All of the text written for R for Biochemists 201
were created as R Markdown. They are all available on 
[Github here](https://github.com/brennanpincardiff/R_for_Biochemists_201).
Have a look... Download, open and Knit.
* Last year, I wrote a manuscript about the _drawProteins_ package
all in R Markdown. The document is here and can be openned and Knit if you want
to play.
